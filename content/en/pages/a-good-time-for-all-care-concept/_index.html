        <p>The Alt-Shift Degrowth festival is committed to creating a space of care, where participants can feel supported, seen, and valued. Our care concept is rooted in the principles of mutual aid, solidarity, and compassion.</p><p>We understand that creating a sustainable and just society requires more than just changing economic and political systems; it also requires a fundamental shift in how we relate to each other and to the natural world. We believe that care is a vital component of this shift, and we are committed to fostering a culture of care at the festival.</p><p>We base our actions on the following principles:</p><p></p><li>Mutual aid: We believe that everyone has something to offer and something to receive. We encourage participants to support each other, whether through sharing resources, skills, or emotional support.</li><li>Solidarity: We recognize that the challenges we face are interconnected and require collective action. We are committed to creating a space where participants can build relationships of solidarity and work together towards common goals.</li><li>Compassion: We understand that the struggle for social and ecological justice can be overwhelming and emotionally taxing. We encourage participants to approach themselves and each other with kindness and compassion, and to prioritize their well-being.</li><li>Accessibility: We are committed to creating a space that is accessible to all participants, regardless of ability, background, or identity. We strive to create an environment that is physically and emotionally safe and inclusive.</li><li>Sustainability: We believe that care for ourselves, each other, and the natural world is essential for creating a sustainable future. We are committed to reducing our ecological footprint and promoting practices that are regenerative and nourishing.</li><p>It follows that we do not tolerate any behaviours that perpetuate sexism, racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination or oppression. We also recognize that creating a space that is free from discrimination and oppression requires ongoing effort and reflection. We welcome feedback from participants on how we can improve and strengthen our commitment to creating a safe and inclusive space for all.</p><p>At the Alt-Shift Degrowth festival, we understand that participants may have a variety of emotional and physical needs during their stay. To support participants in having a safe and enjoyable experience, we will have a dedicated team on-site to address any concerns that may arise.</p><p>This team will be available to participants throughout the festival to provide support and assistance with emotional or physical concerns. Whether you are feeling overwhelmed, need a listening ear, or require medical attention, our team is here to help. They are trained in providing compassionate and confidential support, and will work with you to ensure that your needs are met.</p><p>We encourage all participants to seek out our support team if they need any assistance or have any concerns. Our goal is to create a space that is safe, supportive, and inclusive for all, and our support team plays a vital role in achieving this goal.</p>
