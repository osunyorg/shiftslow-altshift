    <p>Freie Feldlage  <br>   <br>It’s official: Alt Shift is entering a new era - we’re coming to Eastern Germany!!We will be hosted by Freie Feldlage (FFL), a cooperative and community in Harzgerode, Saxony. Freie Feldlage is a cooperative-owned project at a former sanatorium, surrounded by 21 hectares of fields and forested land. Established in 2019, the community consist of individuals and families who were brought together to make the Freie Feldlage into a laboratory for the future of social and ecological change. Step by step, the community aims to restore the buildings of the former sanatorium, creating self-managed housing for 50 to 100 people. The huge site is to be filled with life by the residents and by different cultural events and seminars, too.The community is run by people committed to collective ownership, social justice, and ecological change. FFL is part of the KommuJa network of political communes and we’re excited to get in touch with their network to ground the festival in local antifa resistance and political demands.There’s lakes and rivers nearby so get ready to soak!Check out their website to find out more.</p>  <p> How to get there?  <br>   <br>FFL is about 3 hours by car / 12 hours by bike from Berlin and 1.5 hours by car / 7 hours by bike from Leipzig.Public transportThe nearest train station is Quedlinburg.
