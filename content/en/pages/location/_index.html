    <p>Freie Feldlage  <br>   <br>It’s official: Alt Shift is entering a new era - we’re coming to Eastern Germany!!We will be hosted by Freie Feldlage (FFL), a cooperative and community in Harzgerode, Saxony. It’s a 21-hectare space run by people committed to collective ownership, social justice, and ecological change. One of the buildings used to function as a sanatorium in the 20th century (hope you’re not scared of ghosts!). FFL is part of the KommuJa network of political communes and we’re excited to get in touch with their network to ground the festival in local antifa resistance and political demands.Check out their website to find out more.</p>  <p> How to get there?  <br>   <br>It’s about 3 hours by car / 12 hours by bike from Berlin and 1.5 hours by car / 7 hours by bike from Leipzig.There’s lakes and rivers nearby so get ready to soak!</p>  <p> Some pictures of the place  </p>
