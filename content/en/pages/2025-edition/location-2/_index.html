    <p>Freie Feldlage  <br>We will be hosted by Freie Feldlage (FFL), a cooperative and community in Harzgerode, Saxony. Freie Feldlage is a cooperative-owned project at a former sanatorium, surrounded by 21 hectares of fields and forested land. Established in 2019, the community consist of individuals and families who were brought together to make the Freie Feldlage into a laboratory for the future of social and ecological change. Step by step, the community aims to restore the buildings of the former sanatorium, creating self-managed housing for 50 to 100 people. The huge site is to be filled with life by the residents and by different cultural events and seminars, too. There's lakes and rivers nearby so get ready to soak! Check out their  website  to find out more.  </p>  <p> How to get there  <br>FFL is about 3 hours by car / 12 hours by bike from Berlin and 1.5 hours by car / 7 hours by bike from Leipzig. Public transport Harzgerode has a train station, but it is currently  not in service . To reach Harzgerode, you'll need to take a  bus . Essentially there are two ways to arrive by public transport to Harzgerode  - coming from the south via Sangerhausen or from the north via Quedlinburg. <br>  <br> Sangerhausen: Bus 460 runs every hour on weekdays and every two hours during the weekend  <br> Quedlinburg: Bus 242 runs every hour on weekdays & every two hours during the weekend.  <br>  Please note:  Google Maps does not reliably show the correct bus connections  to Harzgerode. We strongly recommend using the  Deutsche Bahn website  or app  for accurate and up-to-date public transport information.  </p>
