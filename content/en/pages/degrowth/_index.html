Did you know that there are hundreds of proposed policies that could all work together to bring about a degrowth transition?</p>  <p>Increasing well being without economic growth. Universal basic services: guarantee public access to essential services, including education, healthcare, public transport, housing, food and essential utilities to ensure a high quality of life independent of economic growth. Reduced workweek: shorten the workweek to 3-4days do distribute employment more equitably, aiming to decrease unemployment and give people more free time. Job guarantee: create a federally funded but locally adminsitered employment programme offering jobs to all, focusing on projects that yield social and environmental benefits, ensuring meaningful employment opportunities. Debt cancellation: push for the cancellation of debts, particularly for countries in the Global South, to relieve economic constraints and allow for much-needed investment in public services</p>  <p>Reducing material and energy production and consumption. - **Scale Down Harmful Industries:** Equitably reduce the size of industries harmful to the environment, like fossil fuels, industrial animal agriculture, and fast fashion. - **End Planned Obsolescence:** Encourage the design of durable, repairable products to reduce waste and extend product lifespans. - **Cut Advertising:** Reallocate advertising budgets towards promoting sustainable practices and cultural activities, reducing consumerism. - **Shift to Usership:** Encourage models of sharing and renting instead of ownership to lessen the demand for production and reduce waste. - **Money Creation:** Support the principle that governments, rather than banks, should be the primary creators of money to finance public goods and diminish inequality. - **Co-operative Models:** Advocate for businesses to adopt co-operative and steward-ownership models, prioritising community welfare and environmental sustainability over profits.</p>  <p>When talking to friends or family about degrowth policies, remember that they represent a significant shift from the status quo, which can be frightening.

            Exploring the transition to a degrowth economy often leads to the pivotal question: "How do we pay for it?", that's where MMT comes in

            Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) offers a key to unlocking a successful degrowth transformation by showing us that governments can afford to invest in a healthier planet and society without needing the economy to grow.

            MMT teaches us that a country that controls its currency can fund big changes for the environment (ecosystem regeneration, renewable energy deployment, convivial conservation) and communities (job guarantee, universal basic services, community resilience) as long as it keeps an eye on not causing too much inflation (which can be controlled with taxes).

            This means we can focus on what truly matters—building a sustainable world with less waste and more care for people and nature.

            By embracing MMT, we can pave the way for degrowth, shifting resources towards things that make life better for everyone without pressure to constantly increase economic output (GDP).
