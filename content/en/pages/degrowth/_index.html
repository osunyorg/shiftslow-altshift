It advocates for a reduction in material and energy used in production and consumption to align human activities with ecological limits and requires that this reduction is planned and democratic</p>  <p>A key part of this change is to ensure social justice and enhance well-being for all</p>  <p>Degrowth is a not a one-size-fits-all concept but a mosaic of ideas, practices and visions that draw from a variety of sources</p>  <p> Why should we degrow? </p>  <p>Why should we degrow?</p>  <p>Endless growth leads to environmental degradation. Our pursuit of more thas pushed nature beyond its limits, harming the very ecosystems we rely on</p>  <p>Growth deepens inequality. The race for growth benefits a few, leaving many behind. A degrowth approach promotes equity, ensuring resources and opportunities are fairly distributed</p>  <p>More doesnt mean happier. Studies show that beyond a certain point, increased wealth doesn't equate to happiness.</p>  <p>Finite resources, infinite demands. Our planet's resources are limited. Continuing to consume at current rates is unsustainable</p>  <p>Embracing degrowth isnt about individual sacrifice - it's about creating system-wide changes that lead to sustainable, equitable future</p>  <p> Degrowth policies </p>  <p>Degrowth policies. Did you know that there are hundreds of proposed policies that could all work together to bring about a degrowth transition?</p>  <p>Increasing well being without economic growth. Universal basic services: guarantee public access to essential services, including education, healthcare, public transport, housing, food and essential utilities to ensure a high quality of life independent of economic growth. Reduced workweek: shorten the workweek to 3-4days do distribute employment more equitably, aiming to decrease unemployment and give people more free time. Job guarantee: create a federally funded but locally adminsitered employment programme offering jobs to all, focusing on projects that yield social and environmental benefits, ensuring meaningful employment opportunities. Debt cancellation: push for the cancellation of debts, particularly for countries in the Global South, to relieve economic constraints and allow for much-needed investment in public services</p>  <p>Reducing material and energy production and consumption. - **Scale Down Harmful Industries:** Equitably reduce the size of industries harmful to the environment, like fossil fuels, industrial animal agriculture, and fast fashion. - **End Planned Obsolescence:** Encourage the design of durable, repairable products to reduce waste and extend product lifespans. - **Cut Advertising:** Reallocate advertising budgets towards promoting sustainable practices and cultural activities, reducing consumerism. - **Shift to Usership:** Encourage models of sharing and renting instead of ownership to lessen the demand for production and reduce waste. - **Money Creation:** Support the principle that governments, rather than banks, should be the primary creators of money to finance public goods and diminish inequality. - **Co-operative Models:** Advocate for businesses to adopt co-operative and steward-ownership models, prioritising community welfare and environmental sustainability over profits.</p>  <p>When talking to friends or family about degrowth policies, remember that they represent a significant shift from the status quo, which can be frightening. Approach these conversations with humility, gentleness, and respect. </p>  <p> Degrowth values </p>  <p>Degrowth values</p>  <p>Degrowth Values are the deep-seated beliefs and ideals that motivate the movement's vision for society. They represent the ethical foundation upon which the degrowth philosophy is built. </p>  <p>Autonomy & Democracy. Autonomy and democracy are about freeing ourselves from the necessity of working to survive and having the space to make choices collectively ensuring that our communities live and work in ways that feel right to us.</p>  <p>Care. Care is about showing compassion and support for each other, our communities, and all life on Earth. It's about valuing kindness and solidarity over competition and greed.</p>  <p>Justice. Justice means ensuring everyone has a fair chance at a good life, no matter where they come from or what they look like. It's about acknowledging and correcting historical wrongs, reducing excess consumption among those living beyond their fair share, and aiming for social justice and equality.</p>  <p>Sustainability & Sufficiency. Sustainability and sufficiency ensure everyone has what they need to live well within the ecological limits that allow the planet to support and regenerate all forms of life, now and in the future.</p>  <p>Well-being. Well-being is all about living a good, decent and dignified life, where everyone's and everything's health and happiness matter more than how much stuff we own.</p>  <p>Community. Community is about building strong, supportive and resilient networks where we look after each other. It's celebrating togetherness and collaboration, creating a sense of belonging, mutual care and interdependence with each other and our surrounding ecosystems.</p>  <p> How do we pay for degrowth? </p>  <p>How do we pay for degrowth?</p>  <p>Exploring the transition to a degrowth economy often leads to the pivotal question: "How do we pay for it?", that's where MMT comes in</p>  <p>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) offers a key to unlocking a successful degrowth transformation by showing us that governments can afford to invest in a healthier planet and society without needing the economy to grow. </p>  <p>MMT teaches us that a country that controls its currency can fund big changes for the environment (ecosystem regeneration, renewable energy deployment, convivial conservation) and communities (job guarantee, universal basic services, community resilience) as long as it keeps an eye on not causing too much inflation (which can be controlled with taxes). </p>  <p>This means we can focus on what truly matters—building a sustainable world with less waste and more care for people and nature. </p>  <p>By embracing MMT, we can pave the way for degrowth, shifting resources towards things that make life better for everyone without pressure to constantly increase economic output (GDP).</p>  <p> Degrowth on the rise </p>  <p>Degrowth on the rise</p>  <p>Did you know data suggests that a significant number of people are open to, and even support, the idea of prioritizng ecological well-being over profits and relentless economic growth?</p>  <p>A survey done by the German Environment Agency found that 88% agree that "we must find ways of living well regardless of economic growth", and 77% agree that "there are natural limits to growth, and we went beyond them". Source: Umwelt Bundesamt, 2023</p>  <p>A survey of nearly 500 sustainability scholars found that 77% call for post-growth pathways in high income countries. Source: Ecological Economics (2023)</p>  <p>A study exploring two survey datasets found that 61% of the Spanish public hold growth-critical positions (agrowth or degrowth), with less than one-third of respondents in the survey expressing support for green growth. Source: Ecological Economics, 2019</p>  <p>According to a 4-year survey across Brazil, the UK, China and Sweden, an overwhelming majority of people agree with reducing overall consumption and residential energy use and limiting air travel. Similarly, a majority also supports reducing meat consumption. Source: CAST, 2023</p>  <p>Poll shows that 70% of US citizens believe that "environmental protection is more important than economic growth". Source: Yala Climate Opinion Maps, 2018</p>  <p> Degrowth myths and misconceptions </p>  <p>Degrowth myths and misconceptions</p>  <p>Degrowth often sparks vibrant discussions and, inevitably, a fair share of misconceptions. It's a concept that challenges deeply ingrained notions of progress and success, leading to misunderstandings about its goals and implications.</p>  <p>Degrowth vs. Recession. Degrowth isn't about economic decline; it's a conscious shift from GDP-focused growth to enhancing life quality. Unlike a recession, which is unintentional and harmful, degrowth is a deliberate, positive change which puts people and the planet before profits.</p>  <p>Degrowth vs. Recession</p>  <p>Degrowth Means All Sectors Must Shrink. Overall, the world's economy has to shrink because we're using up Earth's resources too fast. However, some sectors and countries must grow (Renewables, Healthcare, Education), and some must shrink (Fast Fashion, Aviation, SUVs).</p>  <p>Degrowth Means All Sectors Must Shrink</p>  <p>Degrowth is Contrary to Human Nature and Progress. Is our nature to progress? Yes. However, degrowth argues that progress isn't about accumulating wealth, power, and status. Degrowth seeks to redefine progress to mean the enhancement of collective well-being and ecological stability, not just individual accumulation.</p>  <p>Degrowth is Contrary to Human Nature and Progress.</p>  <p>Degrowth Demands Only Individual Sacrifices. Degrowth champions a collective endeavour towards sustainability, deeply rooted in community strength and mutual support. It's about enriching lives with connections to people and nature, not isolating individuals or demanding personal sacrifice without communal benefit.</p>  <p>Degrowth Demands Only Individual Sacrifices.</p>  <p>Degrowth as A One-Size-Fits-All Solution. Far from prescribing a universal blueprint, degrowth acknowledges the rich tapestry of global cultures, philosophies and economies that have influenced it. It advocates for context-sensitive approaches that respect local conditions, traditions, and needs.</p>  <p>Degrowth as A One-Size-Fits-All Solution.</p>  <p> We're a member of the IDN </p>  <p>We're a member of the IDN. AltShift is proud to be a member organisation of the International Degrowth Network</p>  <p>The IDN was launched in August 2023 after over 100 individuals and 25 groups approved a proposal detailing the framework, strucutre and decision process of a network od degrowth-aligned groups</p>  <p>The IDN uses sociocracy (like AltShift!) and is organised into regional and thematic circles. AltShift is part of the Events Circle where we collaborate with other degrowth festivals and conferences</p>  <p>Learn more about the IDN through the website degrowth.net</p>  <p> Degrowth database </p>  <p>Let's talk degrowth. Degrowth database. Have you hear about the degrowth database?</p>  <p>It's a cozy corner of the internet where you can find thousands of well-organized resources that can help you further your understanding of degrowth</p>  <p>The database includes information for all types of learners. Whether you prefer scientific papers, videos, podcasts, music, books or forums, the database has it all and more.</p>  <p>You can access the database with this link: degrowth.net/resources/the-degrowth-database</p>  <p> Degrowth & extractivism </p>  <p> Let’s talk degrowth: Degrowth & extractivism. Swipe to read more</p>  <p>At its core, capitalism needs cheap nature. Endless economic growth is fueled by exploiting land, labor and other forms of life. Extractivism and its violent supply chains is the engine to produce economic growth and serves to perpetuate the interests of wealthy classes.  Source: FOE International</p>  <p>Nearly anything can be extracted: Raw materials, data, labour, cultures. But extraction doesn’t happen without harm. Behind it lies a logic of violence: land grabs and forced displacement; pollution of food, water, and air; exploitation of labor and indigenous rights; gender-based violence and systemic discrimination; criminalization of workers and defenders; militarized protection of corporate interests.  Source: FOE International</p>  <p>Extraction operates above all else, and competition for profit spurs economic growth. Economic growth clearly correlates with ecological consumption and on a finite planet that means destruction. Therefore, critiquing extractivism means critiquing economic growth.  Source FOE International</p>  <p>“Degrowth is breaking with the extractivist model of development that benefits growth and accumulation over the well-being of humans and more than human life.” Source: Barbara Taxeira </p>  <p>Degrowth calls for the revaluation of a relational ontology of reciprocity, care, pluriversality and a reinvention of life beyond accumulation. This directly opposes extractivist logics of commodification of life as extractable, exploitable and a source for endless accumulation. </p>  <p>**How?**  –Degrowth directly targets the economic logic of expansion at the imperial core that drives extractivism. [(Source: FOE International)](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/foe/pages/2562/attachments/original/1660621207/143_softcopy.pdf?1660621207#page=7)  –Degrowth challenges the colonial division of labour where the 1% grows by extracting resources and cheap labour from the global majority. [(Source: Miriam Lang)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CEFCE899C62C46DABEF00FE82C5BAFE5/S0260210524000147a.pdf/degrowth-global-asymmetries-and-ecosocial-justice-decolonial-perspectives-from-latin-america.pdf)  –Degrowth promotes relocalization, food sovereignty and democratic control over production. This reduces dependency on extractive industries [(Source: Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877343517300179))</p>  <p>Anti-extractivism has long been led by Indigenous, peasant, and Afro-descendant communities. Degrowth achieves anti-extractivism by amplifying these voices, aligning with pluriversal visions rather than imposing a universal blueprint. [Source:](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/foe/pages/2562/attachments/original/1660621207/143_softcopy.pdf?1660621207#page=7) [Miriam Lang](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CEFCE899C62C46DABEF00FE82C5BAFE5/S0260210524000147a.pdf/degrowth-global-asymmetries-and-ecosocial-justice-decolonial-perspectives-from-latin-america.pdf)  **These are the pathways we will be exploring together at AltShift 2025.**</p>  <p> Resources  <br>   <br>https://explore.degrowth.net/ https://degrowth.info/degrowth   </p>

            Reducing material and energy production and consumption. - **Scale Down Harmful Industries:** Equitably reduce the size of industries harmful to the environment, like fossil fuels, industrial animal agriculture, and fast fashion. - **End Planned Obsolescence:** Encourage the design of durable, repairable products to reduce waste and extend product lifespans. - **Cut Advertising:** Reallocate advertising budgets towards promoting sustainable practices and cultural activities, reducing consumerism. - **Shift to Usership:** Encourage models of sharing and renting instead of ownership to lessen the demand for production and reduce waste. - **Money Creation:** Support the principle that governments, rather than banks, should be the primary creators of money to finance public goods and diminish inequality. - **Co-operative Models:** Advocate for businesses to adopt co-operative and steward-ownership models, prioritising community welfare and environmental sustainability over profits.

            When talking to friends or family about degrowth policies, remember that they represent a significant shift from the status quo, which can be frightening. Approach these conversations with humility, gentleness, and respect.

            MMT teaches us that a country that controls its currency can fund big changes for the environment (ecosystem regeneration, renewable energy deployment, convivial conservation) and communities (job guarantee, universal basic services, community resilience) as long as it keeps an eye on not causing too much inflation (which can be controlled with taxes).

            Degrowth is Contrary to Human Nature and Progress. Is our nature to progress? Yes. However, degrowth argues that progress isn't about accumulating wealth, power, and status. Degrowth seeks to redefine progress to mean the enhancement of collective well-being and ecological stability, not just individual accumulation.

            Degrowth as A One-Size-Fits-All Solution.

It advocates for context-sensitive approaches that respect local conditions, traditions, and needs.

            The IDN uses sociocracy (like AltShift!) and is organised into regional and thematic circles. AltShift is part of the Events Circle where we collaborate with other degrowth festivals and conferences

            At its core, capitalism needs cheap nature. Endless economic growth is fueled by exploiting land, labor and other forms of life. Extractivism and its violent supply chains is the engine to produce economic growth and serves to perpetuate the interests of wealthy classes.  Source: FOE International

            Nearly anything can be extracted: Raw materials, data, labour, cultures. But extraction doesn’t happen without harm. Behind it lies a logic of violence: land grabs and forced displacement; pollution of food, water, and air; exploitation of labor and indigenous rights; gender-based violence and systemic discrimination; criminalization of workers and defenders; militarized protection of corporate interests.

            Extraction operates above all else, and competition for profit spurs economic growth. Economic growth clearly correlates with ecological consumption and on a finite planet that means destruction. Therefore, critiquing extractivism means critiquing economic growth.

            Degrowth calls for the revaluation of a relational ontology of reciprocity, care, pluriversality and a reinvention of life beyond accumulation. This directly opposes extractivist logics of commodification of life as extractable, exploitable and a source for endless accumulation.

            Anti-extractivism has long been led by Indigenous, peasant, and Afro-descendant communities. Degrowth achieves anti-extractivism by amplifying these voices, aligning with pluriversal visions rather than imposing a universal blueprint. [Source:](https://assets.nationbuilder.com/foe/pages/2562/attachments/original/1660621207/143_softcopy.pdf?1660621207#page=7) [Miriam Lang](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CEFCE899C62C46DABEF00FE82C5BAFE5/S0260210524000147a.pdf/degrowth-global-asymmetries-and-ecosocial-justice-decolonial-perspectives-from-latin-america.pdf)  **These are the pathways we will be exploring together at AltShift 2025.**
