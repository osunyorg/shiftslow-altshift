        <p>Want to help tackle climate change but don’t have the time to become a climate scientist? In just 3 hours, the collaborative Climate Fresk workshop will teach you the fundamental science behind climate change and empower you to take action.</p><p>By using / activating the group’s collective intelligence, Climate Fresk enables participants to take ownership of the subject matter. Our methodology doesn’t use a hierarchical learning structure, allowing everyone to take part and find their place in the exercise.</p><p>As participants link the cause and effects of climate change, they are able to take a step back and understand the systemic nature of the challenges. Participants leave the workshop having formed a strong bond with each other, and well equipped to implement the climate actions that they’ve identified.</p><p>And the best is that anyone can become a facilitator: Climate Fresk is a powerful tool to convey basic climate knowledge even to very beginners, to then be able to delve into deeper political discussions.</p>
