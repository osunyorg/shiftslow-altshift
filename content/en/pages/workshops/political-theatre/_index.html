    <p>Theatre of the Oppressed 1: Collective resilience  <br>   <br>In this workshop we will explore together and with our bodies what collective resilience means to us. Against neoliberal tendencies that marketize selfcare, individualize and lead to even more pressure on individuals, we want to approach the topic of resilience systemically and critically. How can groups and collectives be sustainably active? Which structures and group cultures hinder us and which do us good? To what extent do political groups reproduce discrimination and oppression; and how can we intervene against it? And what does all this have to do with degrowth? We will explore these questions on a theatrical research journey using methods from Theatre of the Oppressed. No prior experience is needed - bring comfortable clothes and shoes and let's go! "Let's be careful with each other, so we can be dangerous together".</p>  <p> Theatre of the Oppressed 2: Living Degrowth  <br>   <br>What does it mean to live degrowth? How does the growth society affect our bodies and what would be different in a post-growth economy? Together we want to explore these questions with our bodies and create an open space for reflection. For this we will work with methods of the Theatre of the Oppressed. No previous knowledge or experience is necessary. We will move, discuss, think and have fun together.</p>
