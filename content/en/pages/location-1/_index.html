        <p>The location of the festival is the magical “Kunst in der Natur” or "Art in Nature", a place in the Wachtberg municipality of the forest district of Lower Austria. </p><p>In 1993, Art in Nature was born from the idea of providing a place for people from different backgrounds to exchange artistic ideas and to co-create. Art, music and performances are created in the enjoyment of nature, being surrounded by forests and bodies of water. Whilst the creative spirit still comes alive every year for an art symposium, Art in Nature also provides a nurturing and cosy space for many other initiatives. Community supported agriculture, bodywork, awareness retreats, children's camps, sustainability workshops, weddings, readings and documentary film screenings are only the beginning of the list. Not to mention your favourite degrowth festival ;)</p><p>Due to its unique location, in the middle of nature and surrounded by a warm community of people, Kunts in der Natur became a hub for culture over time and leaves visitors feeling inspired. We are incredibly grateful to be hosted on this special land and by the people living on it. We hope to leave a positive mark and to make it an even more beautiful and vibrant place for all.</p>
