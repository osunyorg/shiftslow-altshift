To make this program a reality there’s a lot of work in the backstage. The team meets twice a year in person and on a weekly basis with online meetings throughout the year. It’s all volunteering work that we put in, but we use some of the budget to support us with basic necessities like food during organisational retreats and reimbursing travel expenses to the festival. Finally, a small part of the organisational budget goes to handling online admin stuff.Then, there are the material costs. We're talking about a compensation for the place that hosts us, which gives us accommodation with all the facilities and part of the equipment for the activities (€4,500 for 7 days of festivity and 6 nights of setup and teardown). Then, very importantly, there are the delicious vegan meals (€3,871 for three meals a day at €7 per person). Finally, the rest of the materials covers everything from hygiene products to decorations, firewood and marketing materials.</p>
