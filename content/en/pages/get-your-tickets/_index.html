We offer three tiers, as well as the option to customise your ticket price.Why do we use this model?We would like to make Alt Shift as accessible as possible and address economic injustice. This tool allows people to access Alt Shift at varying prices, acknowledging that financial resources, including income, should not dictate access to services or care. Some of us struggle to meet our basic needs, while others are able to comfortably provide those basic needs and more. We ask everyone to pay what they can, meaning that if you can pay more, please pay more. If you can’t pay, we will find a price that you are comfortable paying. This allows those with less financial resources to attend the festival! It is a model based on trust, mutual solidarity, and support, and, as such, we hope it helps us create a more inclusive and community-oriented festival. We do not ask anyone to disclose financial information, we ask merely that you choose a price that feels right to you.For visualizing purposes and to get you to reflect on your purchasing power, we propose that you look into the green bottle system.Note on the Custom Price TicketThe intention behind creating a custom price ticket option is to support folks facing structural oppression (through race, gender, class, sexual orientation, etc) under capitalism and the patriarchal system to also have access to the festival. We thus invite everyone to reflect on their respective privileges when applying. We do not ask anyone to disclose financial information, and we trust that everyone takes the decision that feels best for them and the community. We have a limited budget for custom tickets, so we advise you to contact us as early as possible. All tickets are sold on a first come first serve basis, including custom tickets.Follow this link to get your ticket. If you want to request a custom ticket, send us an email containing your name, how much you can pay and what days you want to come to the festival at altshift.festival[at]shiftslow.org</p>  <p> Included in all tickets  <br>   <br>Tickets cover:✧ Delicious, local, vegan food for the whole week (3 meals per day)✧ Water, electricity and all the necessary infrastructure✧ A beautiful camping spot (bring your own tent, or share with someone!)✧ Everyday multisensorial workshops, arts&crafts, bodywork sessions & performances✧ An amazing and eclectic cultural & musical program</p>  <p> About the Ticket Price  <br> Maybe you've been wondering about our ticket prices?  <br>We take transparency as a core value, so we want to break down where your cash is going when you get tickets for the festival. Ticket sales cover about 50% of the festival costs, the other 50% is covered by funding we get from grants. Some of the numbers below are based on last year's festival costs. Now let's look at the costs. First up, we've got our programming costs.  This includes making sure we've got amazing daily activities lined up, like bringing in workshop facilitators, representatives from various social movements across Europe, and putting on great concerts. The fees for the day programme with workshop and roundtable representatives costs about €3500 (15% of the budget) and the artistic and evening programme about €2500 (11%). To make this program a reality there’s a lot of work in the backstage. The team meets twice a year in person and on a weekly basis with online meetings throughout the year. It’s all volunteering work that we put in, but we use some of the budget to support us with basic necessities like food during organisational retreats and reimbursing travel expenses to the festival. This costs about €4900 (21%). Finally, a small part of the organisational budget goes to handling online admin stuff (0,6%). Then, there are the material costs. We're talking about a compensation for the place that hosts us, which gives us accommodation with all the facilities and part of the equipment for the activities for an amazing price of €4000 for 7 days of festivity and 6 nights of setup and teardown (17%). Then, very importantly, there are the delicious vegan meals that cost about €6500 for three meals a day (27%). Finally, the rest of the materials covers everything from tents, hygiene products, decorations, firewood and marketing materials, which cost about €2100 (9%). </p>  <p>   <br>Ticket price breakdown chart. Team expenses: 21,0%. Administration 0.6%. Day program: 14,9%. evening program: 10,6%. Location: 17%. Food 27.1%. Materials: 8.8%.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>https://framaforms.org/join-the-altshift-festival-1649845806?info=republished</p>
