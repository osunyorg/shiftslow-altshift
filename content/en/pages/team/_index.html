    <p>Festival </p>  <p>Alt Shift</p>  <p>Every summer since 2022 AltShift brings together approximately 200 people around the topics of degrowth, eco social futures and global justice and solidarity. The people who join are a wild bunch: from young activists/students that have only recently taken that red pill to more seasoned movement organizers, from eco socialist to anarchists, people involved in activism, politics, the arts-sector, education, academia or cooperatives. And that's the beauty of it, to connect, exchange, discuss, dance, cook, plot the revolutions yet to come, and celebrate the ongoing ones. Festival</p>  <p>In the mornings, social movement anchors speak in interactive roundtables and arts facilitators give hands on workshops. In the afternoons, everyone is invited to host reflection spaces, discussion rounds, reading circles or workshops. We celebrate the joy of missing out and encourage everyone to take a nap in a hammock in the woods once in a while or go for a dip in the river. In the evenings, you shall be bamboozled by movie screenings, concerts, performances, drag shows and di sessions. Programme</p>  <p>In times of polycrises, mere knowledge transmission is not enough. We need to be able to understand ourselves as actors of change. We need to engage in meaning making activities. We need to acknowledge, process and express emotions, together. Concretely, for Alt Shift that means we engage with impulses from political collectives and movements and process them together with arts-based methodologies. That can look like creating cyanotype prints on decolonial futures, experiencing ourselves as collective body in contact dance improvisation, co- creating queerfeminist podcasts or up- cycling our clothes while reading out antifascist poetry. Pedagogy</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Positionality</p>  <p>Alt Shift advocates for eco-social transformation, addressing the root causes of environmental and social crises: power imbalances, resource exploitation, and dominant values that justify them. We reject capitalism as a system that inherently fuels imperialism and racism. Economic growth is no longer seen as necessary for improving human living standards and is recognized as causing widespread socio-ecological damage. We support degrowth as a political and economic project that prioritizes collective well-being over profit, respecting planetary boundaries. Our approach is intersectional and pluriversal, valuing diverse knowledge systems and interdisciplinary resistance to all forms of oppression.</p>  <p>We condemn oppression in all its manifestations, including colonialism, imperialism, white supremacy, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and capitalism. We denounce ongoing settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide in Palestine & Israel, Sudan, Tigray, West Papua, Hawaii, Kurdistan, Western Sahara, Chiapas, Myanmar, Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Somalia, all the CFA Franc using nations, and among Indigenous Peoples, First Nations, Aboriginal Peoples, and Campesines worldwide. We stand in solidarity with liberation movements resisting colonial and imperial domination, recognizing that these struggles are deeply interconnected.</p>  <p>Within our own spaces, we acknowledge the tensions and power imbalances that arise. We encourage self-organized engagement whenever a rejection of planned content, structures, or dynamics emerge in one of our educational spaces. We strive to build diverse, inclusive communities, actively reflecting on privilege-including whiteness, cis-maleness, middle-class status, and European backgrounds-to deconstruct toxic behaviours and create safer spaces for radical social change.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Shift Slow</p>  <p>Shift Slow is an independent cultural association since 2021 with its seat in Vienna, Austria. We understand ourselves as part of a movement aiming for just transition to eco social futures. Our purpose is to create spaces for transformative education, using arts-based methodologies and critical contents around the topics of post-growth, decoloniality, queer feminisms, global justice and solidarity and social movement alliances. Association</p>  <p>We organize AltShift, a degrowth festival; Germinar-t, a degrowth art residency; and participate in various art residencies ourselves, currently working on the topics of archiving working class neighbourhood memories, celebrating peasant knowledges and the right to protest across Europe. Activities</p>  <p>Our association is fully volunteer based. Many of the 10 people on our team met doing the Barcelona Degrowth Masters programme. We are all based in different places in Europe and work mostly online while crystallizing into localized clusters for projects.
