We reject capitalism as a system that inherently fuels imperialism and racism. Economic growth is no longer seen as necessary for improving human living standards and is recognized as causing widespread socio- ecological damage. We support degrowth as a political and economic project that prioritizes collective well-being over profit, respecting planetary boundaries. Our approach is intersectional and pluriversal, valuing diverse knowledge systems and interdisciplinary resistance to all forms of oppression. We condemn oppression in all its manifestations, including colonialism, imperialism, white supremacy, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and capitalism. We denounce ongoing settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide in Palestine & Israel, Sudan, Tigray, West Papua, Hawaii, Kurdistan, Western Sahara, Chiapas, Myanmar, Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Somalia, all the CFA Franc using nations, and among Indigenous amples, Fes Wontice. Dor stand in solidarity with liberation movements resisting colonial and imperial domination, recognizing that these struggles are deeply interconnected. Within our own spaces, we acknowledge the tensions and power imbalances that arise. We encourage self- organized engagement whenever a rejection of planned content, structures, or dynamics at Alt Shift emerge. We strive to build diverse, inclusive communities, actively reflecting on privilege-including whiteness, cis- maleness, middle-class status, and European backgrounds-to deconstruct toxic behaviors and create safer spaces for radical social change.</p>  <p> Contact  <br>   <br>Shift Slow Association</p>  <p>Vienna <br>Austria <br>https://shiftslow-site.netlify.app</p>  <p> Association </p>  <p>Shift Slow</p>  <p>Shift Slow is an independent cultural association since 2021 with its seat in Vienna, Austria. We understand ourselves as part of a movement aiming for just transition to eco social futures. Our purpose is to create spaces for transformative education, using arts-based methodologies and critical contents around the topics of post-growth, decoloniality, queer feminisms, global justice and solidarity and social movement alliances.We organize Alt Shift, a degrowth festival; Germinar-t, a degrowth art residency; and participate in various art residencies ourselves, currently working on the topics of archiving working-class neighbourhood memories, celebrating peasant knowledges and the right to protest across Europe.Many of the 10 people on our team met doing the Barcelona Degrowth Masters programme. We are all based in different places in Europe and work mostly online while crystallizing into localized clusters for projects.We hold intersecting privileges including whiteness, cis-maleness, academic backgrounds, able bodiedness, middle-class backgrounds and EU citizenships. We want to use our privileges to be part of actively dismantling the interlocking systems of white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism. Shift Slow</p>
