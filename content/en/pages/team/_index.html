    <p>  <br>The Alt Shift is organized by the cultural association Shift Slow based in Vienna. Shift Slow stands for a colourful and just transition to eco social futures. With Shift Slow are on a collective investigation: how to create celebratory spaces for conviviality and co-creation for the degrowth movement and beyond?</p>  <p>   <br>Alt Shift advocates for eco-social transformation, addressing the root causes of environmental and social crises: power imbalances, resource exploitation, and dominant values that justify them. We reject capitalism as a system that inherently fuels imperialism and racism.  Economic growth is no longer seen as necessary for improving human living standards and is recognized as causing widespread socio-ecological damage. We support degrowth as a political and economic project that prioritizes collective well-being over profit, respecting planetary boundaries. Our approach is intersectional and pluriversal, valuing diverse knowledge systems and interdisciplinary resistance to all forms of oppression. We condemn oppression in all its manifestations, including colonialism, imperialism, white supremacy, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and capitalism. We denounce ongoing settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide in Palestine & Israel, Sudan, Tigray, West Papua, Hawaii, Kurdistan, Western Sahara, Chiapas, Myanmar, Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Somalia, all the CFA Franc using nations, and among Indigenous Peoples, First Nations, Aboriginal Peoples, and Campesines worldwide. We stand in solidarity with liberation movements resisting colonial and imperial domination, recognizing that these struggles are deeply interconnected.  Within our own spaces, we acknowledge the tensions and power imbalances that arise. We encourage self-organized engagement whenever a rejection of planned content, structures, or dynamics at Alt Shift emerge. We strive to build diverse, inclusive communities, actively reflecting on privilege—including whiteness, cis-maleness, middle-class status, and European backgrounds—to deconstruct toxic behaviors and create safer spaces for radical social change.</p>  <p> Contact  <br>   <br>Shift Slow</p>  <p>   <br>Shift Slow Association</p>  <p>Vienna <br>Austria <br>https://shiftslow-site.netlify.app</p>
