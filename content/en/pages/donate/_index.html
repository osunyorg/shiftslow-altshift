        <p>We met at Vlio's place in Rotterdam in December 2023 for a little arts and crafts residency for the crowdfunding rewards and thought.. why not offer our friends to get one of our wonderful little goodies also after the time of the crowdfunding? Each of the pieces is hand-crafted with much love by Elena, Lara and Vlio. </p>
