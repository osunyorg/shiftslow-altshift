        <p>We met at Vlio's place in Rotterdam in December 2023 for a little arts and crafts residency for the crowdfunding rewards and thought.. why not extend the offer to our friends so they can get one of our wonderful little goodies with any donation? Each piece is hand-crafted with much love by Elena, Lara and Vlio. </p>
