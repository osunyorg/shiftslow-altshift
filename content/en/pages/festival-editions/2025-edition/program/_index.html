    <p>Degrowth Introduction Workshops - 5th August  <br> Degrowth & Class by Ashley Sheets  <br>This workshop will explore the intersections of working-class struggles, environmental justice, and degrowth perspectives. We'll look at how environmental and labor movements can (and do) work together toward just transitions and sustainable futures while fundamentally questioning capitalism's growth paradigm, and why it is imperative to recognise the already-existing alignment between both labour movements led by working class voices, and environmental action. The workshop will include coalition-building ideas, practical examples of global alignment in action, and maybe a bit of theoretical analysis with visioning exercises for post-growth futures! <br>When working-class perspectives are integrated-not merely consulted or given lip service- climate action becomes more democratic, grounded, transformative and responsive to real-life needs and challenges!    <br>Ashley Sheets is a degrowth and environmental labour activist and works as the Project Manager at Sunseed Desert Technology, a non-formal education project and international community in an off-grid village in southern Spain. Her background is in degrowth/post-growth futures, education, and environmental labour. Her work focuses on the intersections where environmental movements and labour activism meet. She is passionate about environmental labour activisms, holistic sustainable living practices, and sharing knowledge that strengthens our collective communities. She is an experienced facilitator and educator.  </p>  <p>Ashley Sheets</p>  <p> Anti-oppression Workshops - 5th August  <br> Somatic Approaches on Gender Justice: Practicing Accountability & Allyship by Somatic Activism Leipzig   <br>In this workshop, we will dive into individual and collective somatic explorations to research how our bodies are and have been shaped by patriarchal power structures. How can we become aware of this and practice embodied consciousness? <br>At the same time, how can we shape and reshape those structures, our communities, and ourselves through embodied action? We will explore our ability to stay accountable and active through an ally and being allied practice. <br>We warmly welcome cis gendered and TIAN* bodies.    <br>Somatic Activism Leipzig is a collective space to explore and integrate political somatics through movement, art and community building.  This workshop will be facilitated by Anno & Celi (they/them, white, able-bodied).</p>  <p>Somatic activism logo</p>  <p> Creative Workshops - 6th to 8th August  <br> Lino Printing as a Tool for Undoing Extractivism by RE-PEAT | 6th August  <br> This hands-on workshop will digest anti-extractivist conversations from the day through the collective, tactile practice of lino printing. Drawing inspiration from soil cores, each participant will carve and print a layer that symbolizes what needs to be returned to the ground: gestures of repair, resistance, and regeneration. Together, these layers form a visual archive of what it means to undo extractive systems. No experience needed, just a willingness to explore with your hands.  </p>  <p>Re-peat logo</p>  <p> Rafoo : Mending Beyond Fabric by Compassion Contagion | 6th & 8th August  <br>Rafoo - an Urdu word means to mend or darn a cloth, by hand stitching over a hole or tear to make it less visible. <br>Mending Beyond Fabric is a slow, tactile workshop in which (Rafoo) mending is used as a metaphor - inviting participants to reflect on personal and collective ruptures, whether internal, historical, or structural, through the intimate, symbolic act of stitching. <br>Through a series of guided prompts, participants engage with fabric- tearing, marking, and mending as a way to explore vulnerability, care, and resistance. Rather than seeking to "fix" what is torn, we ask: What does it mean to stay with the fray? To hold rupture with tenderness? <br>Participants stitch slowly, using visible mending techniques like darning, kantha, or sashiko, patchwork, etc, to create a living archive of what has stretched or worn thin in their lives and communities. In doing so, the workshop becomes a space of liberatory practice, where making becomes a form of quiet resistance against extractivist pressures to produce, to fix, or to explain. Instead, Mending Fabric centers care, slowness, and embodied presence. <br>The workshop will be facilitated by  Rafooghar-the house that mends  - a community space for rest, leisure, and soft resistance located in one of the most marginalized neighborhoods of New Delhi, India. Here, embroidery and textiles are used as tools to share stories, understand each other's lives, and discover solidarity in our everyday struggles, despite our many differences.    <br>Compassion Contagion ​was created as an online archive to document acts of compassion, solidarity and resilience during the pandemic through art, collages and graphic narratives. It's collective of ever growing team of artists, writers, volunteers and activists who believe in the the power of art, activism and storytelling to shift the narrative from despair to that of hope. </p>  <p>Rafoo workshop in a park</p>  <p> Poly(is)topography by Carlo Sella | 6th and 7th August  <br> Poly(is)topography means place (topos), means writing (graphein), means poly (many), means polis (citizens' common ground). It's a collective research to find and write ourselves in/through the space. It's seeing the space as a book where we find inscriptions of our stories, and from there, we try to generate new ones. Poly(is)topography is a script-based collaborative performance, aimed at groups of people wanting to explore the topics of extractivism & antifascism through the here-and-now of our throwntogetherness, also known as (public) space.  </p>  <p> Breathing Like into Post-capitalist Utopias by Maria Syed, Tommy Klug, Charlotte Sophia Bez and Nina Radakovich | 7th & 8th August  <br>The year is 2052. Rising fascism and democratic decay in the early 21st century, coupled with accelerated climate catastrophe and care crisis, fomented a series of mass, transnational revolutions. Utopia Planning Councils have been established to compost fossil legacies based on feminist and decolonial restorative and redistributive justice principles. As a survivor of this revolution and Architect of the After, you are invited to share your vision for a new commune in the region formerly known as Saxony-Anhalt. This immersive workshop invites participants to collaboratively imagine post-capitalist futures through the creation of fictive interview transcripts. The workshop will be rooted in interdisciplinary and intersectional activist practice, (bridging breathwork, creative writing, and decolonial climate justice) and aims to spark bold, collective imaginations for radical futures.  </p>  <p>Breathing life into post-capitalist utopias - year 2052</p>  <p> We Gather in the Cracks: An Invocation of Fugitive Collaborations by Abraham Tettey | 7th & 8th August  <br>In a world increasingly shaped by extractive economies, rising fascisms, and the erosion of collective knowledge, how do we rehearse resistance without replicating the hierarchies we seek to dismantle? <br>We Gather in the Cracks is a participatory workshop designed to address this pressing question by offering an intentional, embodied exploration of collective resistance, care, and disorientation through movement-based practices, embodied learning, and collaborative zine-making.   <br>Abraham Tettey is a Ghanaian artist, curator, and community facilitator working at the <br>intersections of embodied pedagogy, decolonial practice, and ecological thought. Their work has been presented in workshops, residencies, and community spaces across Ghana, Netherlands, Germany and Austria, and is rooted in anti-disciplinary practices that center collaboration, care, and collective authorship. Their workshops often emerge from lived experience, political urgency, and a commitment to creating sustainable, liberatory forms of gathering.  </p>  <p>Zine: are we allowed to talk about history?</p>  <p> Minimal Resources, Maximum Impact: Filmmaking with a Single Camera and Recycled Sound by Kaya van den Handel | 8th August  <br>Join this hands-on, eco-conscious filmmaking workshop where creativity meets constraint. Using just one camera, a basket of recycled props, and found sound objects, participants will explore how to craft powerful one-take slow films that resonate with themes of resistance and liberation. Learn old-school cinematic techniques, collaborate in small groups, and discover how minimal tools can lead to maximum storytelling impact.  </p>  <p> Cultural Program  <br> Gigi Saggi Dance Band | Concert | 5th August   <br>The musicians of the  Gigi Saggi Dance Band  are passionate cooks. So <br>it's hardly surprising that they transform the most (un)ordinary stages into <br>bubbling cooking pots. Their songs combine indie, funk and psychedelia <br>with improvisation and sound experiments, seasoned with live visuals by <br>video artist Eva Luxem. The result is an energetic soup that eventually <br>boils over when the quartet invites with infectious charisma into the <br>psychedelic worlds of slime moulds and microbes, crows and tomato <br>plants. <br>Under the slogan 'Dance Music for Earthly Survival', the Gigi Saggi Dance <br>Band brings together what is often separated: Body and mind, nature and <br>culture, danceable music and transformative futures. <br>They enjoy working with artists and activists: In 2020, they wrote a song <br>for the 'Forno Vagabondo' project by designer Flora Mammana (La <br>Foresta Rovereto), and in 2023 embarked on a journey to Documenta <br>fifteen with cargo bikes alongside the //KOMPOST Ensemble. <br>In March 2025 they released their debut album BLOB MUSIC.  </p>  <p>Gigi Saggi Band</p>  <p> Las Perras del Infierno | Concert | 5th August  <br>Las Perras del Infierno  is an all-female band from Dresden. The musicians themselves come from countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia, and Germany. A combination of freedom and empowerment makes their live show an explosion of emotion and multiculturalism, with Latin American rhythms and Caribbean sounds such as ska, reggae, cumbia, and dembow, mixed with punk!  Las Perras are currently in the process of recording their debut album, which will be loaded with frenetic rhythms that will make you dance while delivering a social message.</p>  <p> Bruno Tomasello | Concert | 5th August  <br>Bruno Tomasello  is an Italian saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist whose work explores the expressive possibilities of the alto saxophone in dialogue with popular and ethnic music traditions. Deeply engaged in total improvisation and extended techniques, he has collaborated with numerous artists in both live performances and recordings. In 2025, he released his first solo album  La terra è pesante , a live project entirely based on improvisation. <br>He has studied with masters such as Ustad Daud Khan Sadozai, Murat Salim Tokaç and Ross Daly, bringing the saxophone into unconventional musical contexts like Afghan music and the Ottoman Makam. Through his multi-instruementalist solo project of instant composition called "Call me Ishmael", born in the summer of 2022, he toured various Italian regions. He was also featured at the Windcraft Music Festival in Cyprus in projects like  The Fellowship of Aeolus , the  Kardjin Quartet , and the  Idaeon Project , confirming his role as a boundary-pushing artist in contemporary music.   </p>  <p>Bruno Tomasello</p>  <p> Barking Varietà by Amaia Rodríguez and Lollo Cattel | Performance | 8th August  <br>What happens when we step out of our usual roles and embrace the unexpected? <br>When a pianist begins to dance, and a dancer starts to sing? When perra ("dog" or <br>"bitch" in Spanish) transforms into a word of empowerment? The energy <br>unleashed can overturn established dynamics, shifting power structures and <br>bringing liberation. Drawing on a reimagining of traditional musical and artistic <br>genres,  Barking Varietà  explores the masks we wear to conform to societal norms <br>of masculinity and femininity. <br>From this exploration emerges a shared moment of freedom through music, dance, <br>and the rediscovery of the body. It is an artistic and personal liberation that invites <br>us to see ourselves and each other beyond imposed roles and expectations. This <br>performance blends dance, physical theatre, and live music, taking inspiration from <br>the eclectic tradition of teatro varietà. Its vibrant, collage-like mix of sounds, <br>languages, and movements reflects the dynamics of power and liberation, while its <br>fragmented structure mirrors the fluid nature of identity: neither fixed nor binary but <br>discovered in diversity and movement.   <br>Amaia Rodríguez (she/her) is a multidisciplinary <br>dancer, political activist and gender studies student based in barcelona. Her <br>artistic projects focus on theatre and queer flamenco, while she has <br>professionalized in the field of workshops, where she combines her political <br>and artistic expertise. Lorenzo Cattel (he/they) is an <br>interdisciplinary artist and philosophy graduate based in milan. They play <br>classical piano, they are a DJ and work as a curator for different performative <br>projects. They wrote their philosophy master's thesis on the philosophy of <br>listening and embodiment of the senses, themes which are applied to their art <br>practices.      </p>  <p> Elijah Kashmir | Performance | 8th August  <br>Born and raised in Odense, Denmark,  Elijah Kashmir's  musical journey is one of rebellion and self-reclamation. A nonbinary Palestinian artist, Elijah blends hard-hitting instrumentals with evocative lyricism to create sonic spaces that challenge, provoke, and heal. In their own words: "Since normal is a system of oppression, let's crash it." <br>With an audacious fusion of electronic, pop, reggaeton, and rap, Elijah crafts soundscapes that hold space for both empowerment and pain-shattering norms while making room for something freer, something raw. <br>Their rise has been marked by milestones that speak to both cultural weight and creative power. Singles like 'NOT ENOUGH' and 'BADU' sparked waves with their unapologetic narratives and unrelenting presence. Elijah has lit up stages across Denmark-from Villa CPH to the Royal Danish Theatre, from SPOT Festival to opening for queer icon Mykki Blanco. A defining moment came at Roskilde Festival, where Elijah performed with Shamelezz to an ecstatic crowd of 20,000. <br>Their work has earned praise in Soundvenue's "Top Tracks" and recognition in Gaffa's "Keep an Eye On" spotlight. In 2023, they were nominated for "Artist of the Year" at the Danish Rainbow Awards. <br>Up next, Elijah Kashmir brings their full spectrum to ALT SHIFT-delivering both a live performance and a genre-bending DJ set that promises to break boundaries and move bodies.  </p>  <p>Elijah Kashmir</p>

        <p>The year is 2052. Rising fascism and democratic decay in the early 21st century, coupled with accelerated climate catastrophe and care crisis, fomented a series of mass, transnational revolutions. Utopia Planning Councils have been established to compost fossil legacies based on feminist and decolonial restorative and redistributive justice principles. As a survivor of this revolution and Architect of the After, you are invited to share your vision for a new commune in the region formerly known as Saxony-Anhalt. This immersive workshop invites participants to collaboratively imagine post-capitalist futures through the creation of fictive interview transcripts. The workshop will be rooted in interdisciplinary and intersectional activist practice, (bridging breathwork, creative writing, and decolonial climate justice) and aims to spark bold, collective imaginations for radical futures.  </p>

        <p>In a world increasingly shaped by extractive economies, rising fascisms, and the erosion of collective knowledge, how do we rehearse resistance without replicating the hierarchies we seek to dismantle? We Gather in the Cracks is a participatory workshop designed to address this pressing question by offering an intentional, embodied exploration of collective resistance, care, and disorientation through movement-based practices, embodied learning, and collaborative zine-making.  </p>

        <p>Abraham Tettey is a Ghanaian artist, curator, and community facilitator working at the intersections of embodied pedagogy, decolonial practice, and ecological thought. Their work has been presented in workshops, residencies, and community spaces across Ghana, Netherlands, Germany and Austria, and is rooted in anti-disciplinary practices that center collaboration, care, and collective authorship. Their workshops often emerge from lived experience, political urgency, and a commitment to creating sustainable, liberatory forms of gathering.  </p>

        <p>The musicians of the <b>Gigi Saggi Dance Band </b>are passionate cooks. So it's hardly surprising that they transform the most (un)ordinary stages into bubbling cooking pots. Their songs combine indie, funk and psychedelia with improvisation and sound experiments, seasoned with live visuals by video artist Eva Luxem. The result is an energetic soup that eventually boils over when the quartet invites with infectious charisma into the psychedelic worlds of slime moulds and microbes, crows and tomato plants. Under the slogan 'Dance Music for Earthly Survival', the Gigi Saggi Dance Band brings together what is often separated: Body and mind, nature and culture, danceable music and transformative futures. They enjoy working with artists and activists: In 2020, they wrote a song for the 'Forno Vagabondo' project by designer Flora Mammana (La Foresta Rovereto), and in 2023 embarked on a journey to Documenta fifteen with cargo bikes alongside the //KOMPOST Ensemble. In March 2025 they released their debut album BLOB MUSIC.  </p>

        <p>What happens when we step out of our usual roles and embrace the unexpected? When a pianist begins to dance, and a dancer starts to sing? When perra ("dog" or "bitch" in Spanish) transforms into a word of empowerment? The energy unleashed can overturn established dynamics, shifting power structures and bringing liberation. Drawing on a reimagining of traditional musical and artistic genres, <b>Barking Varietà</b> explores the masks we wear to conform to societal norms of masculinity and femininity. From this exploration emerges a shared moment of freedom through music, dance, and the rediscovery of the body. It is an artistic and personal liberation that invites us to see ourselves and each other beyond imposed roles and expectations. This performance blends dance, physical theatre, and live music, taking inspiration from the eclectic tradition of teatro varietà. Its vibrant, collage-like mix of sounds, languages, and movements reflects the dynamics of power and liberation, while its fragmented structure mirrors the fluid nature of identity: neither fixed nor binary but discovered in diversity and movement.  </p>

        <p>Born and raised in Odense, Denmark, <b>Elijah Kashmir's</b> musical journey is one of rebellion and self-reclamation. A nonbinary Palestinian artist, Elijah blends hard-hitting instrumentals with evocative lyricism to create sonic spaces that challenge, provoke, and heal. In their own words: "Since normal is a system of oppression, let's crash it." With an audacious fusion of electronic, pop, reggaeton, and rap, Elijah crafts soundscapes that hold space for both empowerment and pain-shattering norms while making room for something freer, something raw. Their rise has been marked by milestones that speak to both cultural weight and creative power. Singles like 'NOT ENOUGH' and 'BADU' sparked waves with their unapologetic narratives and unrelenting presence. Elijah has lit up stages across Denmark-from Villa CPH to the Royal Danish Theatre, from SPOT Festival to opening for queer icon Mykki Blanco. A defining moment came at Roskilde Festival, where Elijah performed with Shamelezz to an ecstatic crowd of 20,000. Their work has earned praise in Soundvenue's "Top Tracks" and recognition in Gaffa's "Keep an Eye On" spotlight. In 2023, they were nominated for "Artist of the Year" at the Danish Rainbow Awards. Up next, Elijah Kashmir brings their full spectrum to ALT SHIFT-delivering both a live performance and a genre-bending DJ set that promises to break boundaries and move bodies.  </p>
