    <p>Degrowth Introduction Workshops - 5th August  <br> Degrowth & Class by Ashley Sheets  <br>This workshop will explore the intersections of working-class struggles, environmental justice, and degrowth perspectives. We'll look at how environmental and labor movements can (and do) work together toward just transitions and sustainable futures while fundamentally questioning capitalism's growth paradigm, and why it is imperative to recognise the already-existing alignment between both labour movements led by working class voices, and environmental action. The workshop will include coalition-building ideas, practical examples of global alignment in action, and maybe a bit of theoretical analysis with visioning exercises for post-growth futures! <br>When working-class perspectives are integrated-not merely consulted or given lip service- climate action becomes more democratic, grounded, transformative and responsive to real-life needs and challenges!    <br>Ashley Sheets is a degrowth and environmental labour activist and works as the Project Manager at Sunseed Desert Technology, a non-formal education project and international community in an off-grid village in southern Spain. Her background is in degrowth/post-growth futures, education, and environmental labour. Her work focuses on the intersections where environmental movements and labour activism meet. She is passionate about environmental labour activisms, holistic sustainable living practices, and sharing knowledge that strengthens our collective communities. She is an experienced facilitator and educator.  </p>  <p> Anti-oppression Workshops - 5th August  <br> Creative Workshops - 6th to 8th August  <br> Lino Printing as a Tool for Undoing Extractivism by RE-PEAT | 6th August  <br> This hands-on workshop will digest anti-extractivist conversations from the day through the collective, tactile practice of lino printing. Drawing inspiration from soil cores, each participant will carve and print a layer that symbolizes what needs to be returned to the ground: gestures of repair, resistance, and regeneration. Together, these layers form a visual archive of what it means to undo extractive systems. No experience needed, just a willingness to explore with your hands.  </p>  <p> Rafoo : Mending Beyond Fabric by Compassion Contagion | 6th & 8th August  <br>Rafoo - an Urdu word means to mend or darn a cloth, by hand stitching over a hole or tear to make it less visible. <br>Mending Beyond Fabric is a slow, tactile workshop in which (Rafoo) mending is used as a metaphor - inviting participants to reflect on personal and collective ruptures, whether internal, historical, or structural, through the intimate, symbolic act of stitching. <br>Through a series of guided prompts, participants engage with fabric- tearing, marking, and mending as a way to explore vulnerability, care, and resistance. Rather than seeking to "fix" what is torn, we ask: What does it mean to stay with the fray? To hold rupture with tenderness? <br>Participants stitch slowly, using visible mending techniques like darning, kantha, or sashiko, patchwork, etc, to create a living archive of what has stretched or worn thin in their lives and communities. In doing so, the workshop becomes a space of liberatory practice, where making becomes a form of quiet resistance against extractivist pressures to produce, to fix, or to explain. Instead, Mending Fabric centers care, slowness, and embodied presence. <br>The workshop will be facilitated by  Rafooghar-the house that mends  - a community space for rest, leisure, and soft resistance located in one of the most marginalized neighborhoods of New Delhi, India. Here, embroidery and textiles are used as tools to share stories, understand each other's lives, and discover solidarity in our everyday struggles, despite our many differences.    <br>Compassion Contagion ​was created as an online archive to document acts of compassion, solidarity and resilience during the pandemic through art, collages and graphic narratives. It's collective of ever growing team of artists, writers, volunteers and activists who believe in the the power of art, activism and storytelling to shift the narrative from despair to that of hope. </p>  <p>Rafoo workshop in a park</p>  <p> Cultural Program  </p>
