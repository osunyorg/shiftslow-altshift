    <p>Degrowth Introduction Workshops - 5th August  <br> Degrowth & Class by Ashley Sheets  <br>This workshop will explore the intersections of working-class struggles, environmental justice, and degrowth perspectives. We'll look at how environmental and labor movements can (and do) work together toward just transitions and sustainable futures while fundamentally questioning capitalism's growth paradigm, and why it is imperative to recognise the already-existing alignment between both labour movements led by working class voices, and environmental action. The workshop will include coalition-building ideas, practical examples of global alignment in action, and maybe a bit of theoretical analysis with visioning exercises for post-growth futures! <br>When working-class perspectives are integrated-not merely consulted or given lip service- climate action becomes more democratic, grounded, transformative and responsive to real-life needs and challenges!    <br>Ashley Sheets is a degrowth and environmental labour activist and works as the Project Manager at Sunseed Desert Technology, a non-formal education project and international community in an off-grid village in southern Spain. Her background is in degrowth/post-growth futures, education, and environmental labour. Her work focuses on the intersections where environmental movements and labour activism meet. She is passionate about environmental labour activisms, holistic sustainable living practices, and sharing knowledge that strengthens our collective communities. She is an experienced facilitator and educator.  </p>  <p> Anti-oppression Workshops - 5th August  <br> Creative Workshops - 6th to 8th August  <br> Cultural Program  </p>
