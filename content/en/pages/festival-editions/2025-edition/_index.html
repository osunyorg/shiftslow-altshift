    <p>AltShift 2025: Building alliances with anti-extractivist, anti-fascist and liberation movements  <br> 3 DAYS OF ROUNDTABLES, WORKSHOPS & CREATIVE SESSIONS </p>  <p>This year, we gather with friends and allies who are resisting extractivism, organizing within antifascist movements, and fighting for global liberation from oppressive systems. Following an opening ceremony and a full day of introductory workshops, we'll dive into three days of roundtables, hands-on workshops, and creative sessions exploring these interconnected struggles. </p>  <p>We'll also reflect on what degrowth can do to meaningfully support these struggles - how it can show up as a better ally, build stronger connections, and challenge systems of domination.Anti-extractivismThis day examines the global impacts of extractivist practices, particularly in relation to technological development and AI supply chains. The panel brings together voices from sites of resistance to mining, data centers, and surveillance infrastructures, while exploring alternative frameworks for technology that prioritize ecological integrity and collective autonomy.  Anti-fascismAs authoritarianism rises and democratic structures erode, this day focuses on strategies for resistance and resilience. Voices from Eastern Germany, Poland, Czechia, and beyond will reflect on community organizing under threat, sustaining movements, and confronting fascism as a continuation of colonial violence, both historically and in the present.  Liberation struggles</p>  <p>"Power can be taken, but not given. The process of the taking is empowerment in itself."- Gloria SteinemThis day explores the deep connections between system change and global liberation movements. In our discussions we center self-determination, anti-colonial resistance, and collective struggles against capitalism,  recognising that environmental justice is inseparable from dismantling systems of oppression.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p> AltShift 2025 is funded by </p>  <p>European Union</p>  <p>Funding Fairer Futures</p>
