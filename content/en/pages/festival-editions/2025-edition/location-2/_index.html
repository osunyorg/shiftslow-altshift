Established in 2019, the community consist of individuals and families who were brought together to make the Freie Feldlage into a laboratory for the future of social and ecological change. Step by step, the community aims to restore the buildings of the former sanatorium, creating self-managed housing for 50 to 100 people. The huge site is to be filled with life by the residents and by different cultural events and seminars, too. There's lakes and rivers nearby so get ready to soak!
