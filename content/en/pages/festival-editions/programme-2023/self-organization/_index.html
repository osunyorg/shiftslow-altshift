        <p>The festival is organised by 4 coordinators, which took on a big chunk of the organisation, so to say as the <i>heads</i> of the organisation. Our orbits, a circle of other 10 people who are engaged in the festival organisation, are our <i>hands</i> and <i>tails</i>. They come 3 days before the festival starts to set it up and stay 3 days longer for the set down. </p><p><b>You</b> are the <i>hearts</i> of the festival, coming for the time period from the 12-19 of August and actively helping out with the different areas we created for everyone to share the (care-)work equitably. </p><p>Amongst the daily task areas you can find kitchen, bar, toilets, space care, dishwashing station, recycling and cat wash station in the camping area. Stay tuned, we will register you for tasks at the welcome hut on the first day. </p>
