        <p>The location of the festival is the magical "<a href="https://www.kunstindernatur.at/about-1/" target="_blank">Art in Nature</a>", a place on the Wachtberg in the forest district of Lower Austria.</p><p>Art in Nature was born in 1993 from the idea of providing a place for people from different backgrounds to exchange artistic ideas and to co-create. Art, music and performance are created in the enjoyment of nature, being surrounded by forest. Community supported agriculture, bodywork, awareness retreats, children's camps, sustainability workshops, readings or documentary films are only a part of the uses of the Wachtberg.</p><p>Due to its unique location, in the middle of nature, the Wachtberg became a hub for culture over time and leaves visitors very inspired.</p><p>We are incredibly grateful to be hosted by this piece of land and the people living on it and to be able to make it an even more beautiful and vibrant place.</p>
