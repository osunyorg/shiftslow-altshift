      Differences in Degrowth by Degrowth Vienna

      text: >-
        <p>Degrowth as an idea, a utopia, and a movement is what unites us. However, like many revolutionary ideas, it is fraught with complexity, divergent views, and inherent conflicts. </p><p>The focus of our workshop will be on unearthing and discussing these conflicts, rather than trying to resolve them. Through open dialogue and guided activities, we'll explore internal and external critiques, as well as differing ideological frameworks, goals, and practices within the degrowth movement. Thus, our workshop emphasizes open exploration and critical engagement within degrowth, not uniformity, conformity and agreement. Together with you we want to create a safe(r) space for everyone to freely express their ideas, opinions and disagreements. </p>
