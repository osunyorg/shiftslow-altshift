        <p>The most convenient and lowest-impact way to travel<br></p><p>is by train. You can take a night train from many</p><p>major European cities to Vienna and from there the</p><p>connection to the festival place is quite easy. Your</p><p>destination is “Buchberg/Kamp”. From there, it is a 15-20 minutes walk up to the place. </p>

        <p>There are two regular toilets as well as compost toilets at<br></p><p>the festival site. Feel free to pee in the woods (without</p><p>leaving toilet paper there – a leaf or two can do :) ). This</p><p>will help save water and let the compost work well. If</p><p>you really need to pee in a toilet, please choose the <br>regular ones: the compost does not like liquids.</p>
