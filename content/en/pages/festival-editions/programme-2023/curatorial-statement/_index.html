        <p>We are inviting proposals for self-organized workshops for "Alt-Shift," a Degrowth festival.</p><p>Self-organized workshops prioritize the collective wisdom and knowledge of the community, rather than relying on traditional hierarchical models of teaching and learning. This approach fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment among participants, who are encouraged to take an active role in shaping the learning experience.</p><p>Our festival seeks to create a space where we can collectively explore and share ideas on creating a sustainable and equitable future. We are looking for workshops that embody new pedagogies, alternative formats, non-frontal approaches, and participative processes.</p><p>We believe that learning is not just an intellectual exercise but should involve the whole person, including the mind, body, heart, and hands. Therefore, we strongly encourage workshop proposals that incorporate a holistic approach to learning. We seek proposals that involve participants in hands-on, experiential activities that engage their bodies and encourage creativity, as well as workshops that prioritize emotional and relational intelligence. Engaging the whole person in the learning process can lead to a deeper understanding and a more profound connection to the subject matter. By incorporating the mind, body, heart, and hands into our learning experiences, we can cultivate a sense of connection to ourselves, each other, and the world around us.</p><p>We encourage proposals that use alternative formats and new pedagogies to create a non-frontal approach to learning. We believe that this approach will create an environment that is conducive to exploring complex ideas, questioning established norms, and fostering creativity. We are interested in welcoming workshops that create a safe and supportive space where all participants can learn and grow together.</p><p>While self-organized workshops at the Alt-Shift Degrowth festival can cover a wide range of topics and approaches, we encourage proposals that have a political dimension and promote social and ecological justice.</p><p>We believe that self-organized workshops can be a powerful tool for political education and activism. By creating a space for critical reflection and discussion, these workshops can challenge dominant ideologies and power structures, and promote alternative models of social and economic organization.</p><p>Inclusivity is key to creating a successful and meaningful workshop. Therefore, we prioritize proposals that manage to create an environment that is welcoming to all, regardless of age, gender, race, or background. We believe that by creating an inclusive space, we can encourage a diversity of perspectives and experiences, which will enrich our discussions and contribute to the learning process.</p><p>Thank you for your initiative and creativity! We are looking forward to welcome you and your proposal to the Alt-Shift Festival!</p>
