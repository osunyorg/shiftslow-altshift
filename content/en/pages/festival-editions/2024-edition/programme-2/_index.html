        <p>We have finally released our delicious program for this year’s edition!<br></p><p>This year’s edition focuses on building alliances with sister movements as we felt that there’s a shared sense of urgency to start threading real mutual support in the degrowth bubble. Together, in open dialogue with you, we want to try to go beyond professing solidarity and actually think about how it can actually look like in practice.<br><br>Check out our programme below! </p>

        <p>Degrowth Copenhagen will be hosting a workshop inspired by the Latin American decolonial feminist method called body-territory. This method involves creating visual maps on bodies to represent personal and social experiences, offering insights into how we relate to our environment. Their goal is to help participants connect with their bodies, recognize the emotional impact of their activism, and foster a sense of community. This ritual will honour all emotions involved in degrowth activism, grounding participants at the festival's start and preparing them for the experiences ahead.</p><p>Degrowth Copenhagen is an open Collective of individuals who share degrowth values and a degrowth vision. Their main activities focus on education, activism and practice. <br></p>

        <p>Degrowth Vienna is hosting a workshop focusing on the intersection of Universal Basic Services (UBS) and Degrowth. UBS, a key topic in the degrowth movement, advocates that everyone, regardless of income or employment, should have access to essential services like mobility, electricity, heat, education, health care, housing, and food. It emphasizes meeting basic needs for a good life and societal participation. The workshop will explore these needs and connect UBS and degrowth to strategies for creating a needs-based, care-centered alternative to the current system.<br></p>

        <p>This workshop will offer some quiet time as we make space for our more-than-human expression through art-making. We will start with a guided meditation to reconnect with the present moment, and then sit outside to listen and receive wisdom from a living being that chooses to come to us. This can be a beetle, a breeze, or a whole ecosystem. After this, we'll return back to our meeting place and spend time embodying the being(s) that communicated with us, and create visual creations from this exploration of our queer and non-dual selves. In the end, we'll share our artworks with each other. This activity takes inspiration from spiritual ecology, ancient wisdom traditions, decoloniality, and ecofeminism.</p><p>Ania Ektate (she/her) is a storyteller, meditation guide, and environmental activist from India. Her art, which takes the form of poems, paintings, short-stories, and essays, seeks to unravel modern-day constructions of human-nature relations. She takes inspiration from ancient wisdom traditions, as well as more recent practices such as mindfulness and spiritual ecology, to re-weave our nature-based narratives. She's been creating spaces for art exploration and meditation since 2021.</p>

        <p>This immersive workshop combines the intuitive practice of Reiki, an indigenous healing system, with a collaborative writing exercise to explore the interplay between energy, perception, and interconnectedness. Participants will first be introduced to Reiki, learning how it enhances natural connections and gently stimulates the body's healing abilities. Following this, attendees will engage in a collective writing exercise, working in small groups to craft a unified declaration on the theme of freedom.</p><p>No prior Reiki experience is necessary; participants are encouraged to bring an open mind, wear comfortable clothing, and come well-rested. This blend of energy work and creative expression aims to shift participants' awareness, fostering a deeper sense of balance and connection with their environment and each other.</p><p>   </p><p>Chantelle is a freelance communications strategist and researcher based between London and Zurich. Originally from Manzini and raised in Johannesburg, she’s interested in otherness, kinship, intimacy, and the radical potential of embodied archives and communal dreaming. With a background in architecture and public relations, she leads communications and co-facilitates a 10-month program at the School of Commons. Chantelle is developing a digital garden and creating spaces for connecting ideas within creative and social change ecosystems. She is an Usui/Holy Fire Reiki practitioner.</p>

      Zula: A Ways and Working Experiment by Chantelle Lue - 1st August

      text: >-
        <p>In this workshop, participants will work together in a shared learning space to discover and develop their own knowledge, using methods that promote collective ownership and shared resources. We will explore often-overlooked, sometimes unconventional methods and approaches that (re)shape our daily practices, learning, and knowledge creation. Drawing on the "<a href="http://www.schoolofcommons.org/waysworkings">Ways and Workings</a>" methodology developed by the School of Commons, participants will engage in a process to identify a commoning approach and/or ways of working that are typically more informal, against-the-grain or emergent, with the aim of creating a broad and alternative, multidimensional directory of how we work together, within and around systems.<br></p>
