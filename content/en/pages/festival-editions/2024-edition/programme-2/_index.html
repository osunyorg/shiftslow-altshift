        <p>We have finally released our delicious program for this year’s edition!<br></p><p>This year’s edition focuses on building alliances with sister movements as we felt that there’s a shared sense of urgency to start threading real mutual support in the degrowth bubble. Together, in open dialogue with you, we want to try to go beyond professing solidarity and actually think about how it can actually look like in practice.<br><br>Check out our programme below! </p>

        <p>Degrowth Copenhagen will be hosting a workshop inspired by the Latin American decolonial feminist method called body-territory. This method involves creating visual maps on bodies to represent personal and social experiences, offering insights into how we relate to our environment. Their goal is to help participants connect with their bodies, recognize the emotional impact of their activism, and foster a sense of community. This ritual will honour all emotions involved in degrowth activism, grounding participants at the festival's start and preparing them for the experiences ahead.</p><p>Degrowth Copenhagen is an open Collective of individuals who share degrowth values and a degrowth vision. Their main activities focus on education, activism and practice. <br></p>

        <p>Degrowth Vienna is hosting a workshop focusing on the intersection of Universal Basic Services (UBS) and Degrowth. UBS, a key topic in the degrowth movement, advocates that everyone, regardless of income or employment, should have access to essential services like mobility, electricity, heat, education, health care, housing, and food. It emphasizes meeting basic needs for a good life and societal participation. The workshop will explore these needs and connect UBS and degrowth to strategies for creating a needs-based, care-centered alternative to the current system.<br></p>

        <p>Inea and JP will bring an interactive workshop to the table that will aim to get participants to reflect on the current state (weaknesses and strengths) of the degrowth community/movement. This workshop will hopefully produce some insights on where degrowth can improve and particularly how it can use its leverage in the global core to be a genuine fighter in the struggle against imperialism and supremacy.</p><p>  </p><p>Inea is Climate Vanguard's in-house political organizer. She aims to serve the collective liberation of human and non-human life through radical social-ecological transformation.</p><p>JP is an organizer with the International Degrowth Network and is increasing his focus on anti-imperial and revolutionary organising/strategizing.</p>
