Check out our programme below! </p>  <p> Degrowth Introduction Workshops  <br> Degrowth in Action  <br>Lucia and Timo will host a workshop revolving around degrowth, critical pedagogies, radical utopias, and decoloniality. Participants will expand their understanding of the deeper root causes that lie beneath ecological breakdown, they will learn to identify capitalist and colonial patterns of our growth-based system and how their groups may reproduce them through narratives and actions participants will also become familiar with degrowth visions and develop capacities of imagining radical utopias. Lucía (she/her) is a sociocultural anthropologist passionate about radical educational projects and an active member of Research & Degrowth. She has coordinated several socio-ecological initiatives and is pursuing a PhD focusing on tradition and folklore in relation to degrowth.

Using the Wheel of Consent as our guide, we'll look at how we make contact and try to realign our habits. What can we learn from saying and hearing "yes"? What about saying and hearing "no"? And all the stuff in between? We'll explore these questions with exercises, games, and conversations, encouraging participants to set their own boundaries.

We are observing at transitions within ourselves, forming bonds of solidarity between each other and voicing demands for political changes. The result will then later be published as part of the latest season of the queer-feminist podcast "Queering the Perspective". We will firstly go into individual and small group brainstorming sessions in which we will establish the most relevant subthemes that we want to dive deeper into. With these in mind, we go into a group conversation, moderated by the podcast host @bela.belissima_ <br>Come with whatever perspective/approach/experience you have towards the topics. We will bring them all together and meet. Béla Belissima is a trans-femme artist, activist & podcaster focusing on the amplification of queer & trans* voices.

We will start with a guided meditation to reconnect with the present moment, and then sit outside to listen and receive wisdom from a living being that chooses to come to us. This can be a beetle, a breeze, or a whole ecosystem. After this, we'll return back to our meeting place and spend time embodying the being(s) that communicated with us, and create visual creations from this exploration of our queer and non-dual selves. In the end, we'll share our artworks with each other. This activity takes inspiration from spiritual ecology, ancient wisdom traditions, decoloniality, and ecofeminism. Ania Ektate (she/her) is a storyteller, meditation guide, and environmental activist from India. Her art, which takes the form of poems, paintings, short-stories, and essays, seeks to unravel modern-day constructions of human-nature relations.

She's been creating spaces for art exploration and meditation since 2021.</p>  <p>Ania</p>  <p> Each One Teach One: Reiki and Collective Writing Workshop by Chantelle Lue - 31st July  <br>This immersive workshop combines the intuitive practice of Reiki, an indigenous healing system, with a collaborative writing exercise to explore the interplay between energy, perception, and interconnectedness. Participants will first be introduced to Reiki, learning how it enhances natural connections and gently stimulates the body's healing abilities. Following this, attendees will engage in a collective writing exercise, working in small groups to craft a unified declaration on the theme of freedom. No prior Reiki experience is necessary; participants are encouraged to bring an open mind, wear comfortable clothing, and come well-rested. This blend of energy work and creative expression aims to shift participants' awareness, fostering a deeper sense of balance and connection with their environment and each other. </p>  <p> Chantelle is a freelance communications strategist and researcher based between London and Zurich. Originally from Manzini and raised in Johannesburg, she’s interested in otherness, kinship, intimacy, and the radical potential of embodied archives and communal dreaming. With a background in architecture and public relations, she leads communications and co-facilitates a 10-month program at the School of Commons. Chantelle is developing a digital garden and creating spaces for connecting ideas within creative and social change ecosystems. She is an Usui/Holy Fire Reiki practitioner.</p>  <p>Chantelle</p>  <p> Zula: A Ways and Working Experiment by Chantelle Lue - 1st August  <br>In this workshop, participants will work together in a shared learning space to discover and develop their own knowledge, using methods that promote collective ownership and shared resources. We will explore often-overlooked, sometimes unconventional methods and approaches that (re)shape our daily practices, learning, and knowledge creation. Drawing on the " Ways and Workings " methodology developed by the School of Commons, participants will engage in a process to identify a commoning approach and/or ways of working that are typically more informal, against-the-grain or emergent, with the aim of creating a broad and alternative, multidimensional directory of how we work together, within and around systems.</p>  <p> Rediscovering Collective Lands by La Foresta - 1st August   <br>The workshop begins with a brief introduction to communal land ownership and the <br>fight against ongoing appropriation in Trentino. This is followed by a creative <br>session where we aim to create small, lightweight, and recyclable visual <br>interventions and signs to draw attention to these land areas and buildings, <br>trying to reintegrate them into collective memory and make appropriation and <br>privatization more difficult. The signs can either be taken to the commons located in the territories where the participants come from or will be used in Trentino. </p>  <p> La Foresta is a community academy, a common good in perpetual evolution that is growing in a regenerated space of the train station in Rovereto, Vallagarina, Trentino. La Foresta hosts and promotes participatory cultural, artistic, economic, culinary, educational, research, environmental, mutual aid, do-it-yourself activities and much more.</p>

This can be a beetle, a breeze, or a whole ecosystem. After this, we'll return back to our meeting place and spend time embodying the being(s) that communicated with us, and create visual creations from this exploration of our queer and non-dual selves. In the end, we'll share our artworks with each other. This activity takes inspiration from spiritual ecology, ancient wisdom traditions, decoloniality, and ecofeminism.</p><p>Ania Ektate (she/her) is a storyteller, meditation guide, and environmental activist from India.

        <p>In this workshop, participants will work together in a shared learning space to discover and develop their own knowledge, using methods that promote collective ownership and shared resources. We will explore often-overlooked, sometimes unconventional methods and approaches that (re)shape our daily practices, learning, and knowledge creation. Drawing on the "<a href="http://www.schoolofcommons.org/waysworkings">Ways and Workings</a>" methodology developed by the School of Commons, participants will engage in a process to identify a commoning approach and/or ways of working that are typically more informal, against-the-grain or emergent, with the aim of creating a broad and alternative, multidimensional directory of how we work together, within and around systems.</p>

        <p>The workshop begins with a brief introduction to communal land ownership and the fight against ongoing appropriation in Trentino. This is followed by a creative session where we aim to create small, lightweight, and recyclable visual interventions and signs to draw attention to these land areas and buildings, trying to reintegrate them into collective memory and make appropriation and privatization more difficult. The signs can either be taken to the commons located in the territories where the participants come from or will be used in Trentino.</p><p>  </p><p>La Foresta is a community academy, a common good in perpetual evolution that is growing in a regenerated space of the train station in Rovereto, Vallagarina, Trentino. La Foresta hosts and promotes participatory cultural, artistic, economic, culinary, educational, research, environmental, mutual aid, do-it-yourself activities and much more.</p>
