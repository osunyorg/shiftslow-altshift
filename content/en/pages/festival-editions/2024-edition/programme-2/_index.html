        <p>We have finally released our delicious program for this year’s edition!<br></p><p>This year’s edition focuses on building alliances with sister movements as we felt that there’s a shared sense of urgency to start threading real mutual support in the degrowth bubble. Together, in open dialogue with you, we want to try to go beyond professing solidarity and actually think about how it can actually look like in practice.<br><br>Check out our programme below! </p>
