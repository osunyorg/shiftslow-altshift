    <p>  <br>Unveiling ShiftSlow's vision beyond <br>the AltShift festival  <br>As we've delved into the AltShift festival's structure, content, and <br>discussions in previous posts, now is the moment to unravel the story behind <br>ShiftSlow, the association behind the festival. Join me in exploring our <br>dreams, challenges, and aspirations that extend far beyond the festival <br>grounds, as we navigate the tapestry woven by ShiftSlow's vision. From bureaucratic roots to a dreamy <br>top  <br> My journey with ShiftSlow <br>started as a bureaucratic necessity—a vessel to manifest the festival. But what <br>unfolded surpassed mere paperwork; AltShift was the seed, ShiftSlow the <br>possibility for it to bloom. This whole process pushed us towards creating an <br>association, while hinting at something far more ambitious. As we navigated the <br>formation of ShiftSlow, questions about our collective journey emerged. And we <br>are still exploring the concrete direction of the journey.  Navigating legal waters   <br> In the process of penning <br>down our association's statutes, we found ourselves at a crossroads of <br>possibilities. Every clause, every word seemed to hold the potential for <br>expansive action. It wasn't merely a legal exercise; it became a moment of <br>exploration. Which topics do we want to bring to the foreground? Which formats <br>besides the festival might be interesting? Would we be able to coordinate these <br>ideas, or would we need partners for that?  <br>While defining the scope of ShiftSlow's activities, I realized that this wasn't <br>just about framing regulations; it was about identifying our potential avenues <br>for transformative impact.  The practical challenges   <br> However, dreams are often <br>constrained by financial realities. As we contemplate expanding our vision, <br>practical questions about sustainability and funding become prominent. <br>"How do we finance this?" reverberates as a constant theme in our regular <br>discussions, extending the dream beyond organizing educational and celebratory <br>events to even imagining workspaces for our team. However, the dream of a <br>shared physical space, where the team could meet face-to-face, proves elusive <br>and somewhat nostalgic in the context of our geographical dispersion. The vast <br>expanse of physical separation among our team members, scattered throughout <br>Europe, creates a concrete challenge. The yearning for a tangible, shared <br>workspace transcends online limitations, reflecting a truth: certain <br>conversations find their most effective expression in shared physical spaces.  Weaving dreams into reality    <br>As I reflect on the profound connection between AltShift festival and <br>ShiftSlow, a colourful weaving of experimental pedagogical formats emerges. <br>AltShift stands as a flagship initiative, where we successfully manifested a <br>dream into reality and crafted a physical space—a temporary utopian world for a <br>few enchanting days. Yet, this feels just as the beginning of something that is <br>yet to uncover. ShiftSlow envisions extending this utopian spirit into the <br>fabric of everyday life, nurturing solidarity, communal living, accountability <br>processes, and collective care. This journey is a curious one, full of possibilities. Looking Ahead…  <br>With ShiftSlow embodying a commitment to a colorful and just transition, our <br>collective investigation moves us into the future. How can we carve celebratory <br>spaces for conviviality and co-creation, maybe even transcending the boundaries <br>of the degrowth movement and reaching into broader horizons? The path forward <br>for ShiftSlow is one of envisioning these broader horizons and venturing into <br>experimental pedagogical realms. Come along on this journey with us, share your <br>thoughts, and let's collaboratively shape the future of ShiftSlow. Your input <br>is highly valued, and together, we'll persist in crafting the story of an <br>equitable, vibrant, and eco-social transition. Stay connected, stay motivated, <br>and let's transform these visions into tangible reality. In solidarity,  </p>  <p> Naomi</p>
