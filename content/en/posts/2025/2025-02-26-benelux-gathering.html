    Benelux Gathering
  summary: >-
    <p>The AltShift community came together for a cozy reunion in November 2024</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On a cold night in mid-November, we gathered in Caro and Flo’s cozy home in The Hague, a perfect meeting point for those travelling from North Holland, Belgium, and northern France. In proper Alt-Shift fashion, we divvied up volunteer shifts – cooking and cleaning – and collectively prepared a delicious feast of veggie stew, rice, wine, and sweets. We spent the night catching up on our lives and reminiscing on our time together in Austria. The conversations were rich, despite knowing one another (for the most part) for a mere few months. We spoke of our shared intellectual pursuits, struggles to find meaningful work, and vested interest in building a more just world.  Together we also created a communal painting (picture below). It was a night of conviviality and warmth, with Fede’s carefully curated soundtrack in the background. I cannot wait for the next time we meet! <br>Text by Sloane Woerdeman Pictures by Sloane Woerdeman and Federico Bermúdez</p>  <p>   <br>2 paintings next to each other with colourful abstract drawings</p>  <p>Collaborative AltShift community painting </p>
